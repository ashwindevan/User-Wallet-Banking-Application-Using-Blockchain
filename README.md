This project proposes the development of a secure user wallet application leveraging 
blockchain technology and robust cryptography. In response to the inherent 
vulnerabilities  of  MD5,  the  project  implements  SHA-256  for  secure  password 
hashing  and  storage  within  a  backend  Database,  enabling  user  authentication 
through  hashed  password  comparison.  A  user-friendly  web  interface  facilitates 
interaction,  while  individual  blockchain-backed  wallets  allow  secure  transactions 
between  users.  Transaction  details  are  immutably  recorded  on  the  blockchain, 
guaranteeing  transparency  and  security.  By  integrating  cutting-edge  cryptography 
and enforcing stricter data constraints, the application offers a secure and transparent 
platform for user financial management. We also implement a User Interface which 
is  user-friendly  and  users  can  make  transactions  that  are  integrated  with  SQL 
Database smoothly.
